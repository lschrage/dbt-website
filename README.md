This website is part of my midterm project for GenEd 1179: Psychotherapy and the Modern Self

A user can go to this website to find healthy coping skills and learn about the Dialectical Behavioural Therapy method.

The ideas behind my app are inspired by the content of this class (particularly by the lectures, sections, and readings that covered DBT, emotional regulation, and suicidal ideation)

I hope you enjoy!
